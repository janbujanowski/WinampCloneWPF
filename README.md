This is one of projects created as a Freelancing Experience (apid project prepared for some other students)
A projects coded for University Course to accomplish it for A degree

* The task is described as below :
###Simple WinAmp clone###
* Your task will be to implement a (very) simple WinAmp 2 clone. Main window of the application is skinned (using standard WinAmp 2/Classic skins in .wsz format) and contains buttons for playing/pausing song, playlist (with next/previous functionality).
* After opening the application user is shown window where he can drop .wsz file containing skin. Skins is loaded and main application window is displayed. User can then drop mp3 files into playlist area, and use buttons to play them (or double clicking song) starts playback. Current song progress and title/album is shown in application window.
* Project can be done in either WinForms or  WPF.
* Not described issues should imitate example application.
###Lab part###
* Loading basic part of skin (main part and equalizer) from skin .wsz file using drag and drop – 4 pt
* Loading all static images from skin (with playlist window part) – 8 pt
###Home part###
* Loading all images, along with animated on hover buttons – 4 pt
* Loading colors, font names for playlist from text file inside skin wsz, loading text color for title/time display from image – 3 pt
* Loading mp3 files to playlist with drag/drop – 1 pt
* Working play/pause/next/previous/stop buttons, with music playback – 2 pt
* Reading tag  from mp3 file and displaying it alongside elapsed time in window – 2 pt
###Tips:###
* Search NuGet (right click on project – Manage NuGet packages) for sharpziplib, taglib and ini-parser
* Unpack demo_skin.wsz to look around
* .wsz files are just .zip archives
* There is build in mp3 playback class in .NET
* Application will be tested on provided skins (2 provided for lab) and one random from selection during home part assessment (tested on example application to work OK). You should test your app with different skins that you can find for example on Deviant Art.

### Summary ###
* Coding time : 12-18h (!)
* It is still not finished, but the exam already passed. 
* TODO Finish sometime in the future :P
